# AQA Plan

This AQA plan outlines our implementation of the [Aqua Book](
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government) for
this project.

The AQA tasks are broken down into the following sections:

<!-- Use reStructuredText contents directive to generate a local contents -->
```eval_rst
.. contents::
    :local:
    :depth: 1
```

This is a **living** document, and should be updated and/or modified as necessary, e.g. if new tasks not listed here
become relevant to project success, please add them to this plan.

## General

These AQA tasks should be considered **at all times** by the entire team.
