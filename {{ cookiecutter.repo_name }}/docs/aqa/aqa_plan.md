# Analytical Quality Assurance Plan
This Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA) plan outlines our implementation of the
[Aqua Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government)
for this project.
The AQA tasks are broken down into the following sections:
- [General](#general) - must be considered at all times by the team;
- [Design](#Design);
- [Build](#build) - for both developers and reviewers; and
- [Release](#release).
This plan is a **living document**, and should be updated and/or modified as necessary, e.g. if new tasks not listed
here become relevant to project success.
## General
These AQA tasks should be considered **at all times** by the entire team.

## Design
These AQA tasks should be considered by team during the pre-project phase, but can be subject to change.

## Build
These AQA tasks should be considered by developers, and completed prior to submitting a Pull/Merge Request. Reviewers
will determine whether your code meets these requirements, and any others they think need to be satisfied, **before any
code is merged**.
Your could should meet **at least** the [minimum standards](#minimum-standard), but also any relevant
[additional tasks](#additional-tasks).

### Minimum standard
Your code should meet these minimum standards.

### Additional tasks
If relevant, your code should also meet these standards as well.

|B14|Assumptions and caveats log   |Formally logged assumptions and caveats? Ideally, you should also add inline comments where major assumptions and caveats apply.                                                                                                              |Review log.

Update Assumptions and caveats log, add comments.|
|B17|Assumption limit testing      |Explored the limits of your assumptions, e.g. very small, very large, zero, and NULL values?<br>Updated the Assumptions log?                                                                                                                  |For new/revised assumptions only. Update Assumptions and caveats log, add comments.|

How do your assumptions perform around their boundaries?<br>Updated the Assumptions log?                                                                                     |For new/revised assumptions only.

|B19|Unit testing                  |Written unit tests for each function? Checked that the tests are valid and pass?<br>Fixed any broken tests (not just removed them)?<br>Understood that test coverage can be a false flag for assurance?                                       |For functions only. Add comments if no/limited tests.                              |
|B20|Integration testing           |Written integration tests for groups of functions?<br>Checked that the tests are valid and pass?<br>Fixed any broken tests (not just removed them)?<br>Understood that test coverage can be a false flag for assurance?                       |For functions only. Add comments if no/limited tests.                              |

Do processes run as fast as they code?<br>Have you considered parallelising?<br>For cloud-based projects, have you written code that minimises cost?<br>For user-facing aspects, are all aspects performing optimally?|Add comments to justify known areas of underperforming code.                       |

## Release
These AQA tasks need to be completed once the product is ready for release.
