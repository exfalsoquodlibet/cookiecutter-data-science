# AQA Plan

This AQA plan outlines our implementation of the [Aqua Book](
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government) for
this project.

This is a **living** document, and should be updated and/or modified as necessary, e.g. if new tasks not listed here
become relevant to project success, please add them to this plan.

The AQA tasks are broken down into the following stages:

* [General](general.md)
* [Design](design.md)
* [Build](build.md)
* [Release](release.md)
