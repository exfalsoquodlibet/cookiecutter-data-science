# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} documentation

The documentation for the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} project 
is generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) in this folder.


## Accessing the documentation

If the documentation has been built by Sphinx, you can find it here in 
[`_build/html/index.html`](./_build/html/index.html).

If not, you can follow the [build instructions](#building-the-documentation) (preferable), or view the Markdown 
[`index.md`](index.md) file directly; note certain reStructuredText directives will not be correctly rendered in the 
Markdown version.

## Building the documentation

To generate the documentation, open a terminal, and `cd` into this folder.

```bash
cd docs
```

Then, use the `html` rule from the [`Makefile`](Makefile) to render the documentation as html files.

```bash
make html
```

The documentation will now be compliled in the `_build/html` folder; access the documentation via the 
[main `index.html` page](./_build/html/index.html).
