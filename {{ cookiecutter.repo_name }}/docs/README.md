# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} documentation

The documentation for the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} project 
is generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) in this folder.

The Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA) Plan can be found [here](aqa/aqa_plan.md), and the Assumptions and Caveats log
is found [here](aqa/assumptions_log.md). A Pull Request (PR) template can be found [here](pull_request_template.md). 
These are all **living** documents, so should be edited as the project progresses.

## Getting started

When you first create your repository, fill out the [AQA Plan](aqa/aqa_plan.md), and add the most relevant and/or 
summary AQA tasks to the PR template [checklist](pull_request_template.md#assumptions-and-caveats).

This template will be used every time a PR is raised, and the checklist is a good nudge to ensure AQA procedures are
followed.

## Accessing the documentation

If the documentation has been built by Sphinx, you can find it here in 
[`_build/html/index.html`](./_build/html/index.html).

If not, you can follow the [build instructions](#building-the-documentation) (preferable), or view the Markdown 
[`index.md`](index.md) file directly; note certain reStructuredText directives will not be correctly rendered in the 
Markdown version.

## Building the documentation

To generate the documentation, open a terminal, and `cd` into this folder.

```bash
cd docs
```

Then, use the `html` rule from the [`Makefile`](Makefile) to render the documentation as html files.

```bash
make html
```

The documentation will now be compliled in the `_build/html` folder; access the documentation via the 
[main `index.html` page](./_build/html/index.html).
